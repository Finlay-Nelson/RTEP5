Low voltage verification procedure to be described here.

DUT control side connected to DC voltage generator outputting 0 and 3V3 to test funcionality.

Mains side connected to signal generator outputting a 20Vpp, 1kHz, 0Voff sine wave across a 10kOhm load resistor.

Scope used to measure voltage across dummy load.

*** Verification Results ***

0V control voltage - 1V across load. (Discrepancy due to bigger load used to limit current from signal generator. Datasheet test cases use 33Ohm load.
3V3 control voltage - 18V5 across load. (Consistent with expected voltage drop across power TRIAC (1V55).

*** Functional Test Outcome **

PASS
