*** RTEP5 MyTea Hardware ReadMe File ***

Each subfolder contains the layout masks, schematics, and BOMs for each PCB used in the project.

The layout masks can be used directly for PCB fabrication. 

The interactive BOMs, when opened with an internet browser, can be used to see individual component placement and track the population of components.

Similarly, the text BOMs show all components used in text form.
